Welcome to the course on “Big Mart Sales Prediction using R”. This is an extensive course on the Big Mart Sales challenge, a regression practice problem wherein we have to predict product-wise and store-wise sales.

Sales prediction is a very common real-life problem that each company faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can have a significant impact on the success and performance of that company. According to a study, companies with accurate sales predictions are 10% more likely to grow their revenue year-over-year and 7.3% more likely to hit quota.
